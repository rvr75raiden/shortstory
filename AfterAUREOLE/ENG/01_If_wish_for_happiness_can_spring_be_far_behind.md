# If wish for happiness, can spring be far behind  

## The end of a new journey  
After a long journey,The place where souls sleep When Freiren and his party arrived  
at the land of Aureole, they were able to converse with the souls of the dead. Who they met and what they talked about in the land of Aureole are matters each should keep to themselves, and although they did not say a word to each other, they all looked equally satisfied.  

"It took a while, but this completes the request that Eizen gave me."  

After joining Fern and Stark, Freiren stretches and briefly shares his thoughts about the journey.  
Seeing his master's straightforward appearance, Fern laughs bitterly, thinking that although it wasn't the kind of journey that could be summed up in such simple words, it was very Freiren-like.  

Thus, Freiren and his party accomplished the purpose of their journey, but Fern felt some regret and a little impatience.  
The long journey that seemed to go on forever came to an end, and at the same time, the reason for being in this party also came to an end.  
Fern was studying under Freiren according to Heiter's will, so if there was no other reason, She should continue to follow Freiren. If possible, She would like to stay by his side forever. ...But what will happen to Stark?  

He will probably return to Eizen to talk about his memories of the trip, which was his original purpose. After that...? Will he continue the journey with him?  

Before She knew it, having Stark beside Fern had become so natural. She felt safe next to him, and it was kind of itchy and comfortable. She realized once again how much She had been taking this situation for granted. The place where souls sleep She felt a sense of urgency as the day drew nearer. She felt like the day when she would have to make a decision about the reality of the end of trip, which she had been putting off, was drawing nearer and nearer.  

"Before heading to Master's place, could you please head to the ruins of... the warrior village in the Kure region?"  

The events that were accelerating towards a conclusion began with a single word uttered by Stark as they left Ende and began preparing to head south.  

To Stark's earnest plea, Frieren simply replies, "Sure," and, as always, the next destination is decided on effortlessly. There is something gloomy about his plea, and Fern can't help but feel that perhaps the time has come.  

## What was once a village  

It took roughly a year for them to travel south. After the three gathered, they had to deal with various events such as conflicts with demons, troubles with nature, and qualification exams, so it took a long time to travel north, but they didn't get caught up in any trouble on the way south, so they made it to the Kure region of the central countries at a steady pace.  

Stark looks down at the land where he spent his childhood.  

"You've returned home."  

The remains of the warrior's village, visible on the other side of the hill, had been left untouched for nearly ten years since Rivera's attack, and even from a distance the row of buildings were in ruins, and upon closer inspection it was clear that monsters had taken up residence there.  

Fortunately or unfortunately, the roaming of the village by vicious monsters meant that thieves could not get close to it, so while the warriors' belongings likely remained, the bodies of the slaughtered warriors were likely eaten by the monsters.  

Stark was gazing at the ruins with a complicated look that seemed both nostalgic and sad, and it felt like Fern was being forced to realize that the conclusion he had been trying not to think about on the journey south was finally drawing near.  

✧ ✧ ✧ ✧  

Fern and Freiren land on the ruins of the village and fire off sonar to detect magical energy. There is a chance that they will notice their presence, but since they plan to annihilate them all, it doesn't matter if they notice.  

Monsters, noticing Freiren and her friends' presence, began emerging one after another from the shadows of the buildings and the surrounding forest.  

"It doesn't seem like a fitting resting place for warriors who risked their lives in battle."  

Frieren confronted the roaring monsters, wary of his approach, and readied his staff.  

"Fern, Stark, we want to set up camp before the sun goes down. Let's get rid of it quickly."  
"Understood."  

Fern responded to Freiren's words by taking out her folded staff and preparing it. However, the monster was about to pounce on Fern. Stark stepped in, his battle axe in hand, blocking Fern's Zoltraak.  

"Master Stark...?"  

Stark hadn't said a word since they'd arrived at the ruins of the village, and seemed to be in a deep depression.  

"...Leave this to me."  

He answered quietly as he brandished his battle axe and leapt at the monsters with the force of a demonic god.  

## At the camp on the ruins of the village  

Most of the monsters that had been in the ruins have been eliminated. However, there are probably still monsters lurking nearby, so we can't let our guard down for a while.  
First, we searched for houses whose roofs and interiors were relatively intact, but all the burnt remains had been left exposed to the elements and were rotting, and even if they had roofs, they seemed in danger of collapsing. In the end, we decided to set up camp in the square in the center of the village.  

"It would be nice if there was a magic spell that could fix wood and stone together. Maybe I should look for one next time? It might be fun to just try making one."  

Freiren said casually while reading a grimoire next to Fern who was preparing dinner.  

(Does Frieren intend to continue her journey of collecting magic?)  

If that's what Freiren wants, her apprentice Fern wants to follow her. She hopes that the three of them will stay together like this. Will Stark continue to accompany them?  

As Fern was thinking this, She noticed that Stark was nowhere to be seen. He must have been exhausted from fighting the monsters, She thought as looked around.  

"Mistress Frieren, what about Master Stark?"  
"Stark has been collecting the belongings ever since the subjugation ended. It's getting dark so I've given him some magic to turn on the lights, but I think he'll be back before it gets really dark."  
"...I'm a little worried."  

"That's right," Frieren muttered, and when she looked towards the place lit by the magical light, she saw Stark silently carrying the dilapidated armor and weapons. At the very least, he would continue doing so until she called him for dinner.  

"As long as Eisen is alive, I guess the people Stark spoke to with in Aureole must have been the people in this village."  
"I heard that he had an older brother. And that he was kind to him during his rigorous training."  

Stark has not told Fern or Frieren any detailed information about Stolz or the people in the village. Fern thought it would be rude to ask Stark any more about it than he told her, since he was immature and had not been taken care of, but his brother was different. However, comparing it with what they had heard during the battle with Rivale, Fern and Frieren could guess the general course of events.  

“So it is because of this dialogue that he are now facing each other… I wonder what Stark plans to do from now on?  
Even if we exterminate the monsters and build a tomb, if we leave it alone it may become a den for bandits.”  

It would be different if there was support from the national or territorial government, but it will likely be a long time before any redevelopment projects are launched on land that has been abandoned for nearly 10 years.  

Later, when dinner was ready, Stark was called back, but he finished eating with a gloomy look on his face and without saying a word, and then went back to sorting through belongings.  

## Warriors' Sword Tomb  

The swords stabbed into the ground in an orderly fashion reminded Fern of the time when they mourned the death of Granat's immortal army. Fern had this feeling as he chased after Stark, who had returned to his work, and looked at the scene that unfolded before her.  

Stark was on one knee in front of the mound of swords, praying with his hands clasped in front of his chest.  

Fern hadn't spoken to Stark, but Stark began to speak bit by bit, as if he had noticed Fern standing behind him from the beginning.  

"The Aureole ,In the midst of all this, I met my brother.  
 I was so happy. I thought we would never see each other again after such a farewell.  
 My brother told me, "It may be a painful memory for me to even think about it now, but please don't think badly of my father, and don't forget  
 about the comrades who fought alongside him to help me escape that situation, as our only hope."  
"Master Stark..."  

When people are confronted with a harsh reality, their defense mechanism is to erase their memories of that time. Even Fern has faint memories of her days with her parents before she met Heiter. Even though she loved them so much, she probably didn't have the strength to face the reality of what she lost as a child.  

"I finally remembered after coming here.  
 I was deceiving myself with cheap words, saying that I wasn't valued because I was poor.  
 I really was able to get to where I am today thanks to the help of so many familys..."  

Stark spoke slowly, his words interspersed with a slight sobbing sound.  

"Everyone... I'm sorry... for it taking so long for it to get to this point..."  

Whenever the faces and names of his fellow warriors from the village that he had been unable to remember until now came back to him, trivial events from his time living in the village flashed through his mind, and no matter how hard he tried to hold back the tears, they began to flow.  

That moment, Stark was slamming his hands on the ground in front of Fern and crying loudly.  

"...Master Stark."  

Fern, too, had no idea how to stop the tears of the most cowardly and brave warrior who had never backed down from the Great Demon, and could only embrace the crying Stark in silence.  

## And so he ends his journey  

"Have you calmed down?"  

After a while, Stark's tears had dried up, but he still looked guilty about having shown the girl his sobbing state. Fern thought   that he probably didn't want anyone to see him like that.  

"Sorry, I saw something embarrassing."  
"No..."  

There is nothing shameful about thinking of someone and crying in mourning, or so Fern thought, but she couldn't express it well.  

"Hey, there's something I want to ask you, Fern."  

--surely  

"I am..."  

--The conclusion of what I've been trying not to think about for so long is  

"I think I'll stay here."  

--This is where it comes out. It's decided.  

"So my journey ends here. "  

The words that had been spoken sounded like they contained a determination that there was no turning back.  

"Master Stark, are you serious...?"  
"...Yeah, could you please tell Frieren? I'm sorry, but I want him to hire a separate vanguard."  

Beneath the moonlight, Stark gazed straight at Fern. He clenched his trembling fists, a gesture he had seen countless times during their journey.  

"I don't want to have any regrets."  
"Master Stark..."  

"As I said before, my journey comes to an end. After I visit my master and tell him about my journey, I will return and rebuild this village.  
 I want to rebuild it. I can't leave the place where my brother, my father, and everyone in the village who fought to help me escape rest like this.   
 It doesn't  have to be a warrior's village, it can be an ordinary village. So that the proud warriors who fought here can rest in peace, and so that at least I can remember until the end."  

"..."  

The hero Himmel and his friends feared that Freiren would disappear from people's memories and be left all alone, so they erected memorial statues in various places.  
Craft, whose name and feats had been forgotten by the people, worshipped the goddess and sought salvation. Stark must also be saddened that his brother and the people of his former village would be forgotten by everyone. He must also be frightened.  

(It's not something I can stop... but)  

--Is this the end? Is this goodbye? Will we never see each other again?  

There are so many things I want to ask Stark, but Fern can't find the words.  

"So, I thought I'd say what I need to say now."  

Stark took a deep breath and gripped his arm tighter to stop it from trembling again.  

"---I... love Fern. I'm so grateful that you've been pushing me forward ever since we met. I've been able to overcome anything because you've been watching over me from behind."  

Fern gasps when Stark tells her that he loves her. However, Stark’s expression is grave.  

"It might take 10 years, no, I don't know if it will take longer, but if this matter calms down and we meet again, if Fern hasn't chosen anyone by then, will you marry me then?"  

Next came the proposal of marriage, but he said it with a look of resignation on his face, as if such a thing would never happen.  

Stark's words entered ears, but Fern didn't sink in. Fern felt like hearts had been connected during long journey, that somewhere deep down their both cared about each other, so why did they ring so hollow?  

“…I thought that a marriage proposal was something to be spun with dreams of a bright future for the two of you. 
 Master Stark … why? Why are you saying it with such a sad look on your face? It sounds as if you want me to turn you down, to cut you off altogether.”  

Stark lowered his gaze slightly with a sad expression on his face and spoke.  

"I... Fern is important to me, so I want to be with her, but I can't just selfishly take Frieren away from Fern, and I can't take Fern away from Frieren."  
"...If so !"  

Won't you come with me? Can't the three of us stay together forever?  

"But I've decided what I have to do,  
 so this is just my own selfish wish and I can't involve Fern or Frieren."  

Stark's face was completely serious as he continued, and Fern, unable to say anything back, ----- ran away from the scene.  

## The teacher is kind and strict  

"Fern!!"  

Should he chase after her? Stark hesitated for a moment, but when he heard footsteps behind him and turned around, he saw Frieren. Frieren's emotions were hard to read, but there was a strange, complex look in his eyes, as if he was a little angry and sad.  

"Stark."  
"Frieren... you've come."  
"I just heard about it, but I can guess the general situation."  
"I see."  

He could tell that the taciturn Freiren was trying to say something.  
Her expression told him that it was something important. Turning her gaze back to Stark, Freiren spoke.  

“Stark, please be a little nicer to Fern. That child has always been… even now that she’s grown up, she’s still hates the loneliest of all.”  

Stark know... That's why Stark wanted to protect Fern.  

"I was just trying to be gentle."  

Now that he had made her cry, there was no way he could say such things to Stark.  

"Usually, but today it's zero points."  
"...that's harsh."  
"Stark, do you have anything to say to Fern after he chases after her?"  

Frieren's words were expressionless and merciless, and sounded cruel to Stark right now.  

"No, but... I can't leave it like this."  

Frieren's expression darkens in exasperation.  

"I know this isn't something I should be saying, but ever since I was a child I've really been bad at these sorts of things.  
 I thought you were more grown up but it seems like you still need a lot of work"  
"I'm sorry..."  

"One of Stark's great points is that he apologizes sincerely, but it's also something that always angers Fern.  
 Do you know why you're being lectured like this?"  
"I thought I knew all about it..."  

Saying that, Stark sighed as he looked up at the moon shining in the night sky.  

“I’ll bring Fern back again. This time you’ll have a proper discussion.  
 I’m sure you’ll come to an outcome that will satisfy both of Stark and Fern.”  

When they first met, Frieren thought she was ignorant of the subtleties of human emotions, but she told Stark with a gentle smile. Without a doubt, Frieren was the most mature of the people present.  

## Her Confession  

The unbearable cold feeling welling up from the depths of heart that She felt as a child. Is this what we call sadness? At the time, She was even prepared to lose everything and die, but now everything Fern have built up won't allow that.  

However, Fern couldn't think of anything right now to stop the feeling that the feelings she had carefully built up were slipping away from between her fingers.  

Fern had escaped and was on her knees crying inside the burnt-out mansion.  

"Fern, I finally found you."  
"Mistress Frieren...?"  
"You've cried so much. Stark will have to be punished later."  

Frieren said this with his fists at his sides in an "angry" pose, and it looked like he was speaking in a playful tone on purpose.  

"That's not it, Mistress Frieren, this is..."  
"It's not that. I kind of know it."  
"..."  
"I wonder who they take after, they're really clumsy kids."  

There was no need to say who he resembled, but it was probably just a joke to lighten the mood. Fern calmed down a bit and took stock of the current situation.  

"It appears Master Stark will be staying here."  
"It looks like it."  
"He said he can't accompany you on the journey any longer."  
"That's all?"  
"...After everything is settled, if we ever meet again, he wants to marry me..."  

Hearing this, Frieren looked up at the sky in shock. "So that's what he said..." she muttered, then turned to Fern.  

"That's quite selfish, or rather, it sounds like you're assuming I'll turn you down."  
"I think that was probably what you intended."  

Freiren sighed and took out a handkerchief to wipe away Fern's tears.  

"I'm worried that I can't do it as well as Zain. It seems such a simple thing to me, so why is it becoming so complicated?"  
"...Mistress Frieren?"  

Freiren put his hands on Fern's shoulders and looked straight into her eyes.  

"Fern and Stark, why The place where Aureole You aimed ?"
"I mean , to speak with the souls of the dead--"   
"No. Eisen asked me to go, and it was because I wanted to.  
 Fern and Stark helped me do that .  
 you looked after me along the way, and I ended up fighting a life-risking battle with the demons, all because they put up with my selfishness."  
"Mistress Frieren, but that's..."  
"It's no different. And yet you accompanied me on the journey I began, and in the end you even became heroes who defeated many of the great demons, mankind's sworn enemies."  
"..."  
"You both risked your lives and were go along with my selfishness for many years."  

To put it very simply, that may be so. However, for Fern, living was about being with Frieren. For Stark, his goal was to go on an adventure in Eisen's place. Now that that was accomplished, there was nothing else to be desired. Fern thought it would continue to be that way. So, Fern shook his head and said, that's not true.  

"Listen Fern. This is important. You and Stark can be a bit more selfish. You don't have to hold back. You can wish for everything you want."  
"Mistress Frieren, but..."  

Fern doesn't know what to hope for or what to wish for. Freiren smiles gently at Fern.  

"Hey, Fern. You may not know this, but I'm actually an elf who has lived for over a thousand years."  

Fern looked confused at this sudden, all-too-familiar confession, but then chuckled.  

"Fufu... what is that mean?"  

Seeing Fern's face finally regain its composure, Frieren breathed a little relief and continued speaking.  

"So, I don't think it's that hard to put up with the selfishness of Fern and Stark for the next few hundred years."  
"...If it takes several hundred years, both myself and Master Stark will be dead."  
"Please accept that I'm prepared for that.  
 Hey, Fern... What do you want, Fern?  
 I want to give you whatever you want, to the best of my ability. I'm sure Stark feels the same way, too. So please be more selfish, Fern.  
 Around 80 years ago, I wasn't even able to realize what I truly wanted.  
 As a result, it might not have been in vain if I had been able to meet Fern and Stark, but Himmel and I were separated by death before we could reach Aureole.  
 Fern, you still have time, right? Because there's something in front of you that you can grab."  

Frieren said, and gently embraced Fern as if soothing a child.  
The moment She tried to tell her not to treat her like a child, She noticed tears flowing endlessly. The emotions She had locked away deep in her heart began to overflow.  
They were not the cold ones from before, but something completely different.  

"Mistress Frieren,!! I...I!!--"  
"Yes. Tell me everything."  

Frieren listened to Fern as he clumsily spoke of the things he had hidden deep in his heart, nodding along to each word.  
Although she always showed a sloppy nature in her everyday life, just at this moment she showed Fern the tolerance and generosity of a mother.  

## And she turns to him  
"Stark, sorry to keep you waiting."  
"Frieren"  

When Freiren brought Fern home, his eyes were red, probably because he had been crying. 
As Fern looked straight at Stark.  
Stark felt relieved that they had come to some kind of conclusion together, but at the same time, he felt a sharp pain knowing that he had made her cry, even though he had sworn to himself one day to cherish her and be kind to her.  

"First, you two can have a full discussion. I'll be waiting over there."  
"Thank you so much."  
"That's fine, that's enough. If we leave it alone, we won't be able to face Himmel or Heiter, and we'll get a lecture from Zain."  

Frieren leaves the place waving her hand. Watching her walk away, it was clear to see that she has changed a lot since the time she said "that's short" after being taken care of for three years at the village that was attacked by the Crimson Mirror Dragon.  

"...Master Stark.  
 First, let me respond to what I said earlier."  

If that was the conclusion she wanted, then he would go all the way. He had done his best.  
"Yes," Stark replied, steeling his resolve.  

"I decline Master Stark's offer."  

Ah, thought so...  

"...I see, I get it."  

Stark looked up at the night sky and pondered Fern's words.  
He had been prepared for this ever since come here and made the decision to stay, but being rejected by someone care about is heartbreaking, but there's nothing can do about it.  

Let's take a break a little further away today...  

Stark couldn’t even look at Fern. The moment he tried to turn eyes and face away from Fern, Fern grabbed both collars of jacket and pulled face in, glaring at him.  

"Whoa."  

There is now a head-long height difference between Stark and Fern, so Stark has to bend down.  

"No! Master Stark doesn't know."  
"What? Why...?"  

Stark, who had expected things to end more neatly and quietly, couldn't understand what was going on and involuntarily cried out in a pathetic voice, but Fern looked relieved for some reason.  

“You've finally returned to your usual self, Master Stark.”  
“No, I was being completely serious.”  
“I told you, a marriage proposal is something that is woven with dreams of a bright future for the two of you.  
 Master Stark, were you really able to imagine a bright future together with me?”  

Remember something Freiren once said. What cannot be imagined cannot be activated even with magic. What cannot be imagined can never be realized.  

"That's..."  
"So I can't accept it all."  

Fern told Stark firmly, looking straight ahead.  

"All of it?! Is it really that bad?"  
"Yes, Master Stark is a total no-no."  

Fern kept responding in rapid succession, and Stark thoughts were unable to keep up.  

"In short, I'm turning down the proposal and saying goodbye here... right?"  
"No, that's not it. That's why I'm saying no to everything."  
"Sorry, I don't understand at all..."  

No longer able to maintain his tense, serious expression, Stark's face became dejected. Seeing this, Fern smiled and said, "He's really a hopeless person."  

"Why are you abandoning your wish to desire everything, Master Stark?"  
"That's because... such selfishness can't be tolerated to that extent..."  

Is it acceptable for one person's selfishness to distort someone's life?  

"I don't want to. I don't want to give up anything."  
"But it's bothering you. It would take a lot of time."  

So he thought he should step back.He thought it would be no trouble for Fern. But the light in her eyes told me that she would not allow that.  

"Mistress Frieren said earlier that he wanted to grant our wishes to the best of his ability. He wouldn't mind if it took hundreds of years. I'm sure  
 Master Stark felt the same way. I would like to be the same way, too."  

Stark felt like I could see Fern's resolve in the light deep in her eyes.  

“Why didn’t you ask me to be by your side and support you in accomplishing what Master Stark wants?”  
“I…”  

--The past doesn't matter. The warrior Stark I've seen has never run away.  

When think about it, it feels like a long time ago, but Stark remember the words he was told when he was receiving a present for my 18th birthday, when he didn't understand what it meant.  

--Might run away from here on out.  

"Master Stark, please do not run from your wishes, and from us."  

--We won't let you get away.  

"But, I..."  

--If you don't choose, I'll choose for you.  

"What do you truly wish for, Master Stark?"  

Fern let go of the collar of Stark's jacket and slowly took both of her hands, brought them up to Stark's chest, and placed them against her forehead.  

(I was making the excuse that I didn't want to cause any trouble and was running away from my true wish.)  

“Tell me, Master Stark. What do you want? What is the future you want to grasp?  
 You always say you don’t know what you really want. But that can’t be the case, right?”  

When Fern spoke, Stark vaguely thought that she looked like a goddess praying wholeheartedly for people's good fortune.  

## Selfishness and Wishes  

Fern felt that the wish she wanted to realize was certainly within her grasp. Stark took several breaths, started to speak but then stopped, and seemed to be choosing his words carefully.  

"I... I want to rebuild this village. My brother, my father, everyone... I can't just leave it like this."  
"Yes..."  

Stark's feelings and resolve must be genuine.  

"...But I want to be with Fern and Frieren too. I can't leave the task of protecting Fern to anyone else. I want it to be just me."  
"Yes..."  

At last, a fragment of Stark's ego and true feelings spill out.  

"So, it may take a lot of time, it may be difficult, I may not be able to travel far anymore, but I want you to be by my side and help me."  

Once all of these things are gathered, Stark's wish will finally be fulfilled.  

--Yes. Let's work hard together.  

The first time he had spoken those words to her was right before they fought against the demons together with Stark.  

(Although a truly disappointing punchline was waiting for me at the time.)  

This time Stark's words were straightforward and full of resolve, but the most important thing was still missing.  

"Is that all?"  
"...I think so, but...?"  

He looked as if he really didn't understand. His expression was aggravated, as if he had forgotten the words he had casually said a moment ago.  


" Really? In the first place, wasn't Master Stark telling us something different? We were talking about a bright future."  

It had been so easy to say it when I had given up, intending for her to refuse... But now it was difficult to convey that to her, who had said from the bottom of her heart that she would accept everything.  
It was embarrassing to the point of death.  
What should I say about a retake at this stage? Stark felt a greasy sweat breaking out on his back.  

"Um, well, what was it again? A bright future... having lots of children... huh? No, maybe not?"  
"...so pervert"  
"Wait, that's not it!"  
"..."  

Fern pouts for the first time in a while, seeing Stark's indecisiveness.  
She looks up at with a face that makes Stark think she can hear her mumbling, and it's so cute. I can't find the words to express my thoughts.  

At that moment, the ground where Stark and Fern were standing began to glow.  
The light gradually converged and eventually turned into flowers, and the area surrounding Stark and Fern became a flower field, with petals blown by the night breeze dancing in the night sky.  

What is this!? Stark wondered as he looked around, and saw Frieren sitting and leaning against a tree, holding a wand in one hand and waving it around with the other.  
Needless to say, it was the magic to make Frieren's flower garden appear. Frieren, who is usually expressionless, was now appealing with a visibly obvious smile.  

"Just tell her already!"  

Even the passage of time was no longer an escape route. Stark began speaking, his mind blank as he tried to restate the situation once more.  

"Well... I mean... I think that once they clear away the rubble, they'll probably build houses to live in around here."  
"Okay, so?"  
"So, um, Fern..."  
"Yes."  

No, he can't look Fern in the eye. Fern is right in front of him  and keeps nodding along, urging him to answer. Stark close  eyes in desperation and tell himself,  

"I love you!"  
"Yes."  
"Will you marry me?"  

Even though Stark hadn't been fully prepared, he was left thinking, "What on earth?" he wondered where had gone to learn to be a gentleman. 
Stark was so embarrassed that he couldn't look Fern in the eye, so he turned away, but he had no choice but to look at her face to hear her reply.  

For some reason Fern didn't say anything. "You're not going to answer me here?" he thought. 
When Stark glanced at her face from the side, she gave him a bright smile as if to say, "Our eyes have finally met."  

"With pleasure."  

So she hugged him, surrounded by magical flowers under the starry sky.  

“I’ve always loved you, even now. I love you, Master Stark――”  

He flew into Stark's chest.  

## Clumsy kids  
"This is fine, right Himmel and Heiter?"  

Freiren, who was watching from a little distance, She remember the exchange  had as we were leaving Aureole.  

"This is my final request to you, Frieren. From now on, never be alone. The bonds you have grasped in your hands should lead you to a future where this is possible.  
 So your battle from now on will be to do everything in your power to protect them."  
"I said this before I died, but please continue to take care of Fern. I don't think it will be just Fern, though."  

Even after death, our former comrades are still so nosy.  
Over there, Stark was smiling, tears in his eyes, and picked up Fern with both hands and started spinning her around in the flower field.  

"Oh, fell down."  

The momentum of the two of them collapsing into the flower field causes petals to fly into the night sky again.  

Since it was related to the Theire future , Freiren had not only been watching from afar, but had also strengthened vision and hearing to closely observe the whole thing. She thought it  would be rude to continue any longer, so She stopped the magic and headed to the square where we were preparing to camp.  

"...They really are just like someone, they're clumsy kids."  

It was a very simple conclusion, but it took a long detour to reach it. It was basically just a matter of "Let's all settle here and live together."  

Perhaps it is because they both have feelings for someone but are too shy to say it that they are drawn to each other.  
Frehren does not know the truth of the matter, but She finds everything about them precious and wants to cherish them forever.  

"Now that I think about it, can memory images be extracted using mind magic?"  

Previously, Edel had shown Mahato's memories of the Golden Land that he had stolen via Denken.  
It would be  masterful feat to cut out 100 years of memories, but it would be possible and interesting to combine a 10-minute cutout of the memory with sound and light magic to create an image and show it to Eisen as a commemorative memory for the two of them.  

"In fact, maybe I don't need to go on a magic collecting journey to kill time."  

She remembered how her teacher had happily written a grimoire every day in his later years, about 1000 years ago. She smiled with satisfaction, thinking that it was okay to spend days like that every now and then in a long life.

--A side note  

Of course, it was not possible for Freiren to sleep alone with the bonfire still on, so she was reading a grimoire while wrapped in a blanket near the fire when Fern returned with a sulky look on his face and Stark with a slap mark on his cheek.  

The two of them just kept repeating "Mr. Stark is so naughty" and "I'm sorry"  

"You came back pretty quickly, but don't humans have children after conversations like that?"  

Frieren had intended it to be a simple question... but the blunt question only added fuel to the fire, and the commotion came to an end with a lecture starting with "Lady Frieren, please sit upright over there," and Stark muttering with a faraway look in his eyes, "Well, we'll have to make a proper house and bedroom, won't we?"
